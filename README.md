# Antonio Caceres: Advent of Code

### Problem Prompts

These scripts are solutions to problems at [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).
Currently, I have written solutions for the 2021 puzzles as they are released.

### File Structure

All solutions are contained in the `solutions` package, sorted by year.
Solutions for a given day's puzzle are contained in the same module.
The `solutions/yr####/data/` folder should contain all puzzle inputs, 
as this constraint is enforced by `utils/read.py`.
